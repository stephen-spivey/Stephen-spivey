**Hi, I'm Stephen** :sunglasses:

I just completed my IBM Data Science certificate and I'm starting to develop a portfolio of machine learning projects.
I also studied data science at Codeup until it closed.
I intend to incorporate data science with my market research and strategy consulting background to develop meaningful
data-based conclusions and recommendations that drive business growth.

My interests include music, fitness and automobiles.
